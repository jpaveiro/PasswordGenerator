# Password Generator
#### Version 1.0

## Requirements
Only Python, ideally v3.10+ (avoid errors), if there is no possible, there will probably be not a problem.

## How to use
First, configure what do you want in 'config.json'.
**Observation**: If all configuration options stay 'false', the program will ask you for active at least one.

After this, execute in terminal:
<code>python password_generator.py</code>
